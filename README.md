## :video_game: Game Features

### AI Ghosts and Pathfinding

One of the key features of this Pac-Man game is the implementation of a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in the artificial intelligence (AI) of the ghosts. The BFS algorithm enhances gameplay by allowing ghosts to intelligently navigate the maze and pursue the Pac-Man through the shortest possible path.

### Resource Management

The game incorporates resource management techniques, including efficient memory allocation.
